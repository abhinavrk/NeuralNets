Python Implementation of a Feed Forward Neural net with multiple hidden layers and back-propagation with momentum.

layered_nn.py is the main code

In Example the code is modified slightly so as to work with handwritten digit recognition. 

It won't work amazingly - we're not expecting it to. FFNets aren't that great at image recognition.
